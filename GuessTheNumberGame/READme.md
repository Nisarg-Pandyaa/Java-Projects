# 🎯 Guess The Number Game

A Java console game that simulates a **multi-player guessing match**  
between a **Guesser**, an **Umpire**, and **three Players**.

---

## 🕹️ Game Concept
- **Guesser** secretly thinks of a number.
- **Umpire** records the Guesser’s number.
- **Players 1, 2, and 3** each try to guess the same number.
- The **Umpire** compares all guesses:
  - If **one** player matches → that player wins.
  - If **two** players match → both are declared winners.
  - If **all three** players match → all three win.
  - If no one matches → the Umpire announces **no winner**.

---

## 💡 Features
- Demonstrates **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP):
  - Separate classes for **Guesser**, **Player**, and **Umpire**.
- Uses `Scanner` for user input.
- Simple game flow with clear winner announcements.
